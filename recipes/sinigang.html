                        Sinigang is a popular and savory Filipino soup known for its distinct sour flavor. It is a comforting and hearty dish that features a tamarind-based broth, although other souring agents such as guava, green mango, or calamansi may also be used. Sinigang is often prepared with a variety of meats, such as pork, beef, shrimp, or fish, and it typically includes an assortment of vegetables.

Include the tamarind-based sinigang mix or tamarind pulp to achieve the desired level of sourness. Other souring agents like guava, green mango, or calamansi can be used as alternatives.</p></li>
