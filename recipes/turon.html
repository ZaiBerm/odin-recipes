        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Turon, also known as banana lumpia or banana spring rolls, is a popular Filipino snack or dessert. It is made by wrapping slices of ripe banana and sometimes with a slice of jackfruit in a spring roll wrapper, then frying the roll until it becomes golden and crispy. Turon is often sweetened with caramelized sugar, giving it a delightful combination of crunchy texture and sweet flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ripe bananas (usually saba or cooking bananas)</li>
            <li>Jackfruit slices (optional)</li>
            <li>Spring roll wrappers (also known as lumpia wrappers)</li>
            <li>Brown sugar</li>
            <li>Cooking oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare the ingredients</h3> <p>Peel and slice the ripe bananas lengthwise. If using jackfruit, cut it into thin strips.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Assemble the turon</h3> <p>Lay out a spring roll wrapper and place a slice of banana (and a slice of jackfruit, if desired) near one edge. Sprinkle brown sugar over the banana.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Roll the turon</h3> <p>Fold the sides of the wrapper over the banana and roll it tightly from the bottom to the top, sealing the edges with a little water to ensure the turon stays closed.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Caramelize the turon</h3> <p>In a separate pan, melt brown sugar over medium heat until it caramelizes. Some variations may include adding a bit of water to make a caramel syrup.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Fry the turon</h3> <p>Heat cooking oil in a deep pan for frying. Carefully place the assembled turon into the hot oil, frying until it becomes golden brown and crispy.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Drain and cool</h3> <p>Remove the fried turon from the oil and let them drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil. Allow them to cool for a few minutes.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3> <p>Serve turon while still warm. The crispy exterior contrasts with the sweet and soft interior, creating a delightful combination of textures. Turon is often enjoyed as a snack or dessert in the Philippines.</p></li>
