            <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>

            <li>Optional: 1 teaspoon sugar for a slightly sweet balance</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Marinate the chicken</h3> <p>In a large bowl, combine the chicken, soy sauce, minced garlic, crushed peppercorns, and bay leaves. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour, or even overnight for more flavor.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Sauté the Aromatics</h3> <p>Heat oil in a large pan or pot over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until translucent.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Cook the chicken</h3> <p>Add the marinated chicken to the pot, including the marinade. Allow the chicken to brown slightly on all sides.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Simmer</h3> <p>Pour in the vinegar and add water. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer until the chicken is tender. This usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Adjust seasoning</h3> <p>Taste the adobo and adjust the seasoning. You can add salt, pepper, or a teaspoon of sugar for a slightly sweet balance. The adobo should have a good balance of savory, tangy, and slightly sweet flavors.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3> <p>Serve the Chicken Adobo over steamed rice. The sauce is flavorful and can be drizzled over the rice. Enjoy!</p></li>
